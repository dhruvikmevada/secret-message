This project demonstrates a Python script that parses an HTML table containing `x`, `y` coordinates and a Unicode character, then displays the parsed data in a formatted grid.

## How It Works

The program fetches the HTML content from a URL, parses the table to extract the coordinate and Unicode character information, and generates a grid by placing the Unicode characters in the appropriate positions based on the provided `x`, `y` coordinates.

### Key Features

- **Data Parsing**: Parses the table from the HTML page and extracts the data into a structured format.
- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: The grid size is dynamically created based on the maximum `x` and `y` coordinates in the table.
- **Unicode Display**: The Unicode characters are placed in the grid based on their coordinates, and the grid is printed in a readable format.
